# TenjiTag

## Purpose

To help blind people in Japan identify household objects by making custom 3D-printed braille tags in Japanese.

## Details

The files are for the OpenSCAD design software using a common braille file. There is a tag to use with a rubber band on tins and cartons, and a clip for packets. Still a work in progress, in particular the clip.
